                    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Food Waste Index 2021 report reveals that people wasted 931 million tonnes of food material in the year 2019,
out of which 61 % is contributed by households, 26 % by food services, and 13 % by retail; Indian households
waste 50 kilograms of food annually per individual.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            The large quantities of food waste created by the worldwide
food system is a critical issue that is getting major focus owing to its environmental and socio- economic impacts.
                        </li> 
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Internationally, since visibility regarding sustainability, food wastage and impoverishment is on the high, the
requirement to understand the behaviour patterns behind reducing food wastage and food insecurity is the need of
the hour.
                        </li>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                        Food plays a critical part in the economic, social, political and cultural lives of every nation. The citizens of every
                        nation can help substantially to economic, socio- political and environmental sustainability by embracing and
                        rejecting certain behaviour patterns with regard to food.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Hence, it is crucial to analyse and acknowledge the
                    motivational elements, structural components and processes which aids or come in the way of reducing food waste
                    behaviour.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Therefore it is critical to study and understand the theories behind food wastage behaviour and ways
                    to change them constructively. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                          TPB by Ajzen seems more significant owing to its equitable way of calculating
                    the components of food waste reduction or avoidance behaviour in particular.</ul>
